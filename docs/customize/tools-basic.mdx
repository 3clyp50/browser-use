Custom actions are functions *you* provide, that are added to our [default actions](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/browser_use/controller/service.py) the agent can use to accomplish tasks.

Action functions can request [arbitrary parameters](/customize/tools-parameters#action-parameters-via-pydantic-model) that the LLM has to come up with + a fixed set of [framework-provided arguments](/customize/tools-parameters#framework-provided-parameters) for browser APIs / `Agent(context=...)` / etc.

<Note>
  Our default set of actions is already quite powerful, the built-in `Controller` provides basics like `go_to_url`, `scroll_down`, `extract_content`, [and more](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/browser_use/controller/service.py).
</Note>

It's easy to add your own actions to implement additional custom behaviors, integrations with other apps, or performance optimizations.

For examples of custom actions (e.g. uploading files, asking a human-in-the-loop for help, drawing a polygon with the mouse, and more), see [examples/custom-functions](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/tree/main/examples/custom-functions).

## Quick Example

Here's a simple custom action that asks a human for help:

```python
from browser_use import Controller, ActionResult

controller = Controller()

@controller.action('Ask human for help with a question')
def ask_human(question: str) -> ActionResult:
    answer = input(f'{question} > ')
    return ActionResult(extracted_content=f'The human responded with: {answer}', include_in_memory=True)

# Then pass your controller to the agent to use it
agent = Agent(
    task='...',
    llm=llm,
    controller=controller,
)
```

<Note>
  Keep your action function names and descriptions short and concise:
  - The LLM chooses between actions to run solely based on the function name and description
  - The LLM decides how to fill action params based on their names, type hints, & defaults
</Note>

## What You Can Do With Custom Actions

Custom actions enable you to:

- **Integrate with external services** - Call APIs, databases, or other systems
- **Add domain-specific logic** - Implement business rules or specialized workflows
- **Optimize performance** - Create faster alternatives to default actions for specific use cases
- **Handle file operations** - Upload, download, or process files
- **Enable human-in-the-loop** - Ask for user input or approval when needed
- **Access browser internals** - Use Chrome DevTools Protocol for advanced browser control

## Browser Interaction Context

<Note>
Browser Use has moved from Playwright to Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) for browser interaction. The `browser_session` provides access to CDP through `browser_session.agent_focus.cdp_client` or `await browser_session.get_or_create_cdp_session()`. Playwright is only used internally to install the browser binary, but all browser interaction is done via CDP.
</Note>

Your custom actions can interact with the browser in several ways:

- **Direct CDP access** for low-level browser control
- **Event-based actions** for structured browser interactions  
- **High-level browser session methods** for common operations

Learn more about these approaches in the [Tools Parameters](/customize/tools-parameters) section.

## Important Rules

1. **Return an [`ActionResult`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Abrowser-use%2Fbrowser-use+%22class+ActionResult%28BaseModel%29%22&type=code)**: All actions should return an `ActionResult | str | None`. The stringified version of the result is passed back to the LLM, and optionally persisted in the long-term memory when `ActionResult(..., include_in_memory=True)`.

2. **Type hints on arguments are required**: They are used to verify that action params don't conflict with special arguments injected by the controller (e.g. `browser_session`)

3. **Actions functions called directly must be passed kwargs**: When calling actions from other actions or python code, you must **pass all parameters as kwargs only**, even though the actions are usually defined using positional args.
