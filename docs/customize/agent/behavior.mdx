Control how the agent operates:

```python
agent = Agent(
    task="your task",
    llm=llm,
    controller=custom_controller,  # For custom tool calling
    use_vision=True,              # Enable vision capabilities
    save_conversation_path="logs/conversation"  # Save chat logs
)
```

## Behavior Parameters

- `controller`: Registry of functions the agent can call. Defaults to base Controller. See <a href="/customize/custom-functions">Custom Functions</a> for details.
- `use_vision`: Enable/disable vision capabilities. Defaults to `True`.
  - When enabled, the model processes visual information from web pages
  - Disable to reduce costs or use models without vision support
  - For GPT-4o, image processing costs approximately 800-1000 tokens (~$0.002 USD) per image (but this depends on the defined screen size)
- `vision_detail_level`: Controls the detail level of screenshots sent to the vision model. Can be `'low'`, `'high'`, or `'auto'` (default). Using `'low'` can significantly reduce token consumption and cost for simpler visual tasks, while `'high'` provides more detail for complex visual analysis.
- `save_conversation_path`: Path to save the complete conversation history. Useful for debugging.
- `override_system_message`: Completely replace the default system prompt with a custom one.
- `extend_system_message`: Add additional instructions to the default system prompt.

<Note>
  Vision capabilities are recommended for better web interaction understanding,
  but can be disabled to reduce costs or when using models without vision
  support.

## Reuse Existing Browser Context

By default browser-use launches its own builtin browser using Playwright-installed chromium.
You can also connect to a remote browser or pass `browser_session` or `browser_profile` objects to the Agent.

These all get passed down to create a `BrowserSession` for the `Agent`:
