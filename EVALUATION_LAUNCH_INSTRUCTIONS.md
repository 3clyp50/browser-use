# Launch Evaluation Instructions

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Improvements Completed

The browser-use improvements have been successfully implemented and are ready for evaluation!

## üìã Summary of Changes

**Branch:** `browser-use-improvements-phase1`

### Key Improvements:
1. **System Prompt Optimization** - Reduced length, clearer structure, better todo.md guidance
2. **Enhanced Error Recovery** - Actionable error messages with specific suggestions
3. **Loop Detection** - Automatic detection and breaking of stuck patterns
4. **Better Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff and improved transient failure handling

## üöÄ Launch Evaluation Run

To test these improvements with **gpt-4o-mini** as requested, use one of the following methods:

### Method 1: GitHub Actions UI (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/actions
2. Select "Run Evaluation" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Configure parameters:
   - **Branch:** `browser-use-improvements-phase1`
   - **Model:** `gpt-4o-mini`
   - **Eval Group:** `phase1-improvements`
   - **Developer ID:** `browser-use-analysis`
   - **User Message:** `Testing Phase 1 improvements: system prompt optimization, error recovery, and loop detection`
   - **Max Steps:** `30`
   - **Parallel Runs:** `3`
   - **Test Case:** `OnlineMind2Web`

### Method 2: GitHub CLI (if available)

```bash
gh workflow run .github/workflows/eval.yaml \
  --ref browser-use-improvements-phase1 \
  -f model=gpt-4o-mini \
  -f eval_group="phase1-improvements" \
  -f developer_id="browser-use-analysis" \
  -f user_message="Testing Phase 1 improvements: system prompt optimization, error recovery, and loop detection" \
  -f max_steps=30 \
  -f parallel_runs=3 \
  -f test_case="OnlineMind2Web"
```

### Method 3: Repository Dispatch API

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/browser-use/browser-use/dispatches \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "evaluation_request",
    "client_payload": {
      "git_ref": "browser-use-improvements-phase1",
      "script_args": {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "eval_group": "phase1-improvements",
        "developer_id": "browser-use-analysis", 
        "user_message": "Testing Phase 1 improvements: system prompt optimization, error recovery, and loop detection",
        "max_steps": 30,
        "parallel_runs": 3,
        "test_case": "OnlineMind2Web"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Metrics to Monitor:
- **Task Success Rate:** Should improve due to better error recovery
- **Loop Detection:** Fewer agents getting stuck in infinite loops
- **Error Recovery:** More successful recovery from transient failures
- **Todo.md Usage:** Better task planning and progress tracking
- **Step Efficiency:** Reduced wasted steps due to better guidance

### Comparison Points:
Compare against baseline runs to see improvements in:
1. Overall completion rate
2. Average steps to completion
3. Error recovery success rate
4. Frequency of infinite loops
5. Quality of task planning (todo.md usage)

## üìÅ Files Modified

- `browser_use/agent/system_prompt.md` - Optimized and consolidated
- `browser_use/controller/service.py` - Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- `browser_use/agent/service.py` - Added loop detection and todo.md guidance
- `browser_use_analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis document
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed summary of all changes

## üéØ Success Criteria

The evaluation should demonstrate:
- ‚úÖ Reduced failure rates
- ‚úÖ Better error recovery
- ‚úÖ Fewer infinite loops
- ‚úÖ Improved task planning
- ‚úÖ More actionable error handling

## üìù Next Steps After Evaluation

1. **Analyze Results:** Compare metrics against baseline performance
2. **Identify Further Improvements:** Based on remaining failure patterns
3. **Phase 2 Planning:** Advanced features like memory system re-enablement
4. **Iterate:** Refine based on evaluation feedback
