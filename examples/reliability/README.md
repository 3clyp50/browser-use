**Use Case**: Critical automation requiring 99%+ success rate
**Expected Behavior**: Comprehensive validation and detailed error reporting

## Configuration Patterns

### Reliability Optimization Techniques

1. **LLM Configuration**:
   ```python
   llm = ChatOpenAI(
       model='o3',                       # Most capable model
       temperature=0.0,                  # Deterministic responses
       timeout=120,                      # Extended timeout
   )
   ```

2. **Browser Settings**:
   ```python
   browser_profile=BrowserProfile(
       headless=False,                   # Visible for debugging
       wait_between_actions=2.0,         # Longer waits for stability
       viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080},  # Full HD
       deterministic_rendering=False,    # Keep disabled for performance
   )
   ```

3. **Agent Settings**:
   ```python
   agent = Agent(
       flash_mode=False,                 # Full system prompt
       use_thinking=True,                # Enable reasoning
       max_actions_per_step=3,           # Conservative action limit
       max_failures=5,                   # More retries
       retry_delay=10,                   # Longer retry delay
       step_timeout=180,                 # Extended timeouts
       vision_detail_level='high',       # High accuracy
       validate_output=True,             # Enable validation
   )
   ```

## Reliability Features

### Step-by-Step Execution
The example demonstrates a comprehensive approach to reliable automation:

1. **Explicit Validation Points**:
   - Wait for page load completion
   - Validate element visibility
   - Confirm action success
   - Take screenshots for verification

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Retry failed actions with delay
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Graceful degradation
   - Debug information collection

3. **Loading Validation**:
   ```
   - Wait for the page to fully load (look for indicators)
   - Validate: Confirm expected elements are visible
   - Validate: Check page title and content
   - Report any issues encountered
   ```

### System Message Enhancement
```python
extend_system_message="""
RELIABILITY PROTOCOL:
- Always wait for pages to fully load before taking actions
- Validate each action's success before proceeding
- If an element is not found, wait 3-5 seconds and retry
- Report step completion status explicitly
- Prioritize accuracy and completeness over speed
"""
```

## Task Structure

The reliable task example follows this pattern:

```
RELIABILITY PRIORITY: Execute each step carefully and validate completion.

STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION PLAN:

1. [Action Description]
   - Wait for [specific condition]
   - Validate: [specific check]
   - Report: [completion status]

2. [Next Action]
   - [Detailed instructions]
   - Validate: [expected outcome]
   
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- After each step, explicitly state "Step X completed successfully"
- If any step fails, wait 5 seconds and retry once
- Always wait for loading indicators to disappear
```

## Performance vs Reliability Trade-offs

| Aspect | Reliability Focus | Speed Focus |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Temperature | 0.0 (deterministic) | 0.1-0.2 (faster) |
| Wait Times | 2.0s (stable) | 0.0-0.1s (fast) |
| Retries | 5 attempts | 1-2 attempts |
| Timeouts | 180s (extended) | 30s (quick) |
| Actions/Step | 3 (conservative) | 8-10 (aggressive) |
| Vision Detail | High (accurate) | Low (fast) |
| Browser Mode | Visible (debug) | Headless (speed) |

## Monitoring and Debugging
