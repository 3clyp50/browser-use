Reliability-Focused Example: Step-by-Step Execution with Loading Validation

This example demonstrates how to configure browser-use for maximum reliability using:
- Step-by-step prompts with numbered instructions
- Temperature 0 for deterministic behavior
- OpenAI o3 model for superior reasoning
- Proper loading validation after each action
- Comprehensive error handling and retries

@file purpose: Demonstrates reliability-focused configuration with step-by-step execution

RELIABILITY PRIORITY: Execute each step carefully and validate completion before proceeding.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Wait for each page to fully load before taking any action
- Validate that each action was successful before proceeding
- If an element is not immediately visible, wait 3-5 seconds and try again
- Take screenshots after critical actions for verification
- Report any issues encountered during execution

STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION PLAN:

1. Navigate to https://github.com
   - Wait for the page to fully load (look for the GitHub logo and navigation)
   - Validate: Confirm the page title contains "GitHub"
   - Validate: Confirm the search box is visible

2. Search for "browser-use"
   - Click on the search input field
   - Wait for the search field to become active
   - Type "browser-use" slowly and clearly
   - Validate: Confirm the text appears in the search field
   - Press Enter to search
   - Wait for search results to load completely

3. Locate and click on the browser-use repository
   - Wait for search results page to fully load
   - Look for "browser-use/browser-use" in the results
   - Validate: Confirm the repository appears in search results
   - Click on the main repository link (not issues, discussions, etc.)
   - Wait for the repository page to load completely

4. Extract repository information
   - Wait for the repository page to fully load
   - Validate: Confirm the repository name "browser-use" is visible
   - Validate: Confirm the star count is visible
   - Validate: Confirm the description is loaded
   - Extract and report:
     * Repository name
     * Star count
     * Fork count
     * Main programming language
     * Description

5. Verify data accuracy
   - Double-check all extracted information is visible on screen
   - Validate: All numbers are properly formatted
   - Validate: All text is complete and not truncated
   - Report final results with confidence level

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- After each step, explicitly state "Step X completed successfully" or report issues
- If any step fails, wait 5 seconds and retry once before reporting failure
- Always wait for loading indicators to disappear before proceeding
- Take time to ensure accuracy over speed

RELIABILITY PROTOCOL:

- If an element is not found, wait 3-5 seconds and retry
- Report step completion status explicitly
