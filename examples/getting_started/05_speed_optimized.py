Getting Started Example 5: Speed-Optimized Browser Automation

This example demonstrates how to configure browser-use for maximum speed:
1. Flash mode enabled (disables thinking and evaluation steps)
2. Fast LLM (Llama 4 on Groq for ultra-fast inference)
3. Reduced wait times between actions
4. Headless mode option (faster rendering, default off for visibility)
5. Extended system prompt to encourage concise responses
6. Optimized agent settings for speed

Perfect for production environments where speed is critical.

SPEED OPTIMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be extremely concise and direct in your responses
- Skip unnecessary explanations and focus on actions
- Use multi-action sequences whenever possible to reduce steps
- Prioritize efficiency over detailed reasoning
- Get to the goal as quickly as possible
