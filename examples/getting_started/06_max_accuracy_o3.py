Maximum Accuracy Example with O3 Model

This example demonstrates how to configure browser-use for maximum accuracy
using the O3 model with optimized settings and specific prompting techniques.

@file purpose: Demonstrates maximum accuracy configuration with O3 model,
focusing on precision over speed with longer wait times and careful step execution.

@dev You need to add OPENAI_API_KEY to your environment variables.

Accuracy and precision instructions:
- Take your time to carefully analyze each page state before acting
- Double-check element selectors and ensure you're targeting the correct elements
- Verify that actions were successful before proceeding to the next step
- If an action fails, analyze why and try alternative approaches
- Be thorough in your reasoning and explain your thought process clearly
- When extracting data, cross-reference multiple sources if available
- Always validate that the information you extract is complete and accurate
- If you're uncertain about any element or action, describe what you see and ask for clarification
- Focus on precision over speed - accuracy is the primary goal
