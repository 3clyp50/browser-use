# Browser-Use Agent Analysis & Improvement Opportunities

## Overview
Analysis of the browser-use codebase to identify areas for improvement in agent performance, focusing on system prompt optimization, action reliability, and error recovery.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. System Prompt Issues
- **Length & Complexity**: The system prompt is 162 lines and quite dense, potentially overwhelming the LLM
- **Redundant Instructions**: Some rules are repeated in different sections
- **File System Guidance**: Todo.md usage instructions could be clearer and more actionable
- **Action Sequencing**: Multi-action rules could be simplified

### 2. Agent Service Issues
- **Disabled Memory**: Memory system is completely disabled (`if self.enable_memory and False:`)
- **Error Recovery**: Limited mechanisms for getting unstuck from loops
- **Step Logic**: Complex step execution logic makes debugging difficult
- **File System State**: Inconsistent state management between steps

### 3. Controller/Action Issues
- **Action Descriptions**: Some actions have overly verbose descriptions that confuse the LLM
- **Error Messages**: Not always actionable (e.g., "Element not found" without suggesting next steps)
- **Element Indexing**: Poor handling when page elements change mid-sequence
- **Retry Logic**: Insufficient retry mechanisms for transient failures

### 4. Planning & Execution Issues
- **Todo.md Usage**: Agents often don't update or properly maintain todo.md files
- **Progress Tracking**: Limited visibility into task completion progress
- **Goal Decomposition**: Poor breaking down of complex tasks into subtasks
- **State Recovery**: No mechanism to recover from partial task completion

## Specific Improvement Areas

### High Priority Fixes

1. **System Prompt Optimization**
   - Simplify and consolidate redundant rules
   - Make todo.md usage instructions more prescriptive
   - Add specific patterns for common task types
   - Improve action sequencing guidance

2. **Error Recovery Enhancement**
   - Add specific patterns for when agent gets stuck
   - Improve element not found error handling
   - Add fallback strategies for common failure modes
   - Better detection of infinite loops

3. **Action Reliability**
   - Improve element indexing stability
   - Add more descriptive error messages
   - Enhance wait/retry logic for dynamic pages
   - Better handling of page state changes

4. **File System Management**
   - More consistent todo.md updating patterns
   - Better guidance on when to save vs. append results
   - Clearer file system state persistence

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Planning System**
   - Better task decomposition guidance
   - Progress tracking mechanisms
   - Milestone-based execution

2. **Action Optimization**
   - Reduce action description verbosity
   - Add more targeted action types
   - Improve parameter validation

3. **State Management**
   - Better browser state caching
   - Improved session persistence
   - Enhanced download tracking
